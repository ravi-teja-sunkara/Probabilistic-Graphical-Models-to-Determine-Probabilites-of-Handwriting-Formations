# Probabilistic-Graphical-Models-to-Determine-Probabilites-of-Handwriting-Formations
Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) have been developed to determine the probabilities of observations for handwriting patterns which are described by several variables obtained by document examiners. Multiple PGMs were built for handwritten ‘th’ and ‘and’ image datasets and comparisons were provided.
